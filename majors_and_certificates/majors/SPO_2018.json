This course is designed to introduce students to research methods and to guide them in the production of their first Junior Paper.\n\nConcentrators should discuss as soon as possible their area of interest with the Director of Undergraduate Studies in order to find the most appropriate advisers for the Junior Papers. By the end of September (first JP), and by mid-February (second JP), all juniors should have contacted their advisers to discuss a plan of work.\n\nThe first JP (Fall semester) should be about 4,000 words, and the second JP (Spring semester) should be between 5,000 and 8,000 words. Both JPs can be written in English, in which case a three-page summary in the target language must be provided. Or, the JPs can be written in the target language in which case a summary is not needed. Any extensions beyond the University deadline date need pre-approval from both the Director of Undergraduate Studies and Residential College Dean. All JPs must include Princeton University's honor pledge.\n\nConcentrators following two languages are encouraged to write one JP in each of the languages of concentration.",

      "explanation": "<i>Editor's Note: Concentrators of this major do not enroll in any numbered course for this requirement, so TigerPath does not check it.</i>\n\nStudents should select a Senior Thesis adviser by the end of September at the latest. The Senior Thesis is normally written in English, and should be between 15,000 and 20,000 words. Topics chosen in the past have ranged over the whole field of Spanish and Portuguese studies, from linguistic problems and literary techniques through close textual analysis to thematic and ideological studies. Students primarily interested in culture and civilization have written on art, political and economic issues, education, and a variety of social questions. The senior thesis is a major commitment of a student's time and energy, and the most important yardstick for choosing a topic is willingness to spend many hours on a particular set of texts or problems. Please visit the Mudd Library website for inspiration and a listing of previous senior thesis topics over the years. More detailed information can be found in the Senior Thesis Handbook.",
