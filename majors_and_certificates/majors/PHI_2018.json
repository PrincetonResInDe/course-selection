Cognates may not be used for both courses in a distribution area (and standards for approval are generally more liberal for courses that are not used for distribution requirements than for courses that are, and again more liberal for a first cognate than for a second). In general courses considering means other than philosophical argument (e.g. appeal to religious revelation, tradition, authority, faith) have been used to answer questions of a kind considered in philosophy, and courses considering philosophical works from a non-philosophical standpoint (e.g. as literary texts, emphasizing rhetorical style, or as historical documents, emphasizing external influences) are considered valuable supplements but not substitutes for philosophy courses, and hence not suitable as cognates.\n\nCourses that have been routinely approved as cognates in recent years include: all courses listed under the Politics department as courses in political theory; most courses listed under the History department as courses in history of science; and a few courses listed under area studies programs covering those aspects of the intellectual history of certain non-Western civilizations that invite comparison with the history of philosophy in the West. Other courses may be approved on a case-by-case basis.",

The seminar provides a transition from course work to fully independent work. A junior seminar meets weekly for an hour or biweekly for two hours to discuss readings selected by the instructor, and each student writes a final paper, normally of at least 5,000 words, on a topic in the area defined by those readings, usually chosen by the student from a list provided by the instructor. (The student's grade for fall semester independent work will be based mainly on this paper, but it is usually based partly on shorter papers and/or oral presentations in the seminar earlier in the term.) During spring semester of the junior year, independent work consists of writing a junior paper -- an essay on a philosophical topic, normally of at least 5,000 words--under the supervision of an individual faculty adviser (different from the student's fall seminar instructor).",
