      "explanation": "Generally, either 215-217 or 216-218 or 203-204-215 are strongly recommended for admission to the department. Prospective mathematics majors should consult the department early and plan a program that includes as much of the 215-217 or 216-218 sequence as possible. Most majors begin taking courses at the 300-level by the second semester of the sophomore year, in preparation for their junior independent work.\n\nSome of our successful majors became interested in mathematics as a major after taking 103 or 104. Such students should consult with the Junior Advisor or the Associate Departmental Representative as soon as possible.",

However, there are no formal length requirements. Some of the best senior theses in mathematics over the years have been under 10 pages, while others have been over 100 pages, although about 20-40 pages when single-spaced seems typical. Senior theses are evaluated on the same basic criteria as junior papers, but naturally more originality and imagination in the exposition and content are expected in senior theses.\n\nThe senior thesis is due by the university set deadline (usually, the start of the spring reading period). The thesis is evaluated by both the adviser and a second reader; thus, a second reader should be arranged at least a couple of weeks before the due date of the senior thesis (ideally much sooner). The thesis is \"defended\" to both the adviser and the second reader during a thesis defense that occurs a couple of days after Dean's date, during the final examination period. The defense consists of a short (about 25 minute) presentation by the student, followed by questions from the readers pertaining to the content of the thesis. Two grades are given: one for the quality of the presentation and defense (to emphasize the importance of mathematical communication), and one for the thesis itself.\n\nThe primary adviser for the senior thesis can be a university faculty member outside the mathematics department (which is allowed, supported, and indeed occurs frequently). In this case, the second reader must be arranged within the mathematics department. (This is to help ensure uniformity in the evaluation process.)\n\nSenior thesis grades, together with grades in mathematics courses, are also taken into account when determining departmental honors.",
