All seniors are required to participate in a research or engineering\nproject. All projects must include elements of engineering design (engineering design is the\nprocess of devising a system, component, or process to meet desired needs). The following\ncourses satisfy this requirement: MAE 439 Senior Independent Work (one semester, fall);\nMAE 440 Senior Independent Work (one semester, spring); MAE 442 Senior Thesis (yearlong);\nMAE 444 Senior Project (year-long). Students are strongly encouraged to select\nthe year-long project or thesis option. Senior projects are intended for teams or groups\nwhile senior thesis is intended for individuals. For senior project or thesis, work begins in\nthe fall but enrollment is only in spring term when a double grade is awarded. Please note:\nIf a student has selected to participate in a year-long project or thesis and is enrolled in only\nthree courses during the fall semester, it is required that they will enroll in Senior Project or\nThesis during the spring semester. For these students, it will NOT be possible to drop-down\nto a one-semester course of Independent Work without incurring a failure for Independent\nWork in the fall term. In Spring term you must enroll in three courses plus senior thesis or\nsenior project (senior thesis and senior project count as two courses). Therefore your senior\nyear course load will be 3 in fall and 5 in spring as opposed to 4 in fall and 4 in spring.\nThere are NO exceptions to this rule even if your total number of courses will exceed 36.",
