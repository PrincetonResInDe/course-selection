  explanation: To enter the Department of Molecular Biology, students must have completed
    MOL 214 with a grade of C or better. CHM 201/207 and 202, or one unit of chemistry
    AP credit and CHM 202 or 215, or two units of chemistry AP credit, are also required
    to enter the department. An alternate path into the department is through the
    integrated science curriculum

      from the Department of Chemistry. The organic chemistry requirement must be
      completed before the beginning of the junior year.

    explanation: Students satisfy the quantitative requirement by taking one course
      in statistics (SML 201, ORF 245, or MOL 290) and one course in either computer
      science (COS 126 or above) or math (MAT 103, 104, 175, 192, or any 200-level
      MAT course). SML 201 and COS 126 are the recommended choices for most students.
      AP credit cannot be used toward the fulfillment of the quantitative requirement.
      Courses taken at other institutions can be substituted for the second required
      course (but not for the statistics course), if approved by the corresponding
      department.

    before senior year. All four departmental core courses count toward the eight
    required departmentals. No substitutions are allowed except in the case of study
    abroad which, if it entails intensive research and with advanced permission, can
    substitute for MOL 350. Note that MOL 345 may be taken concurrently with CHM 302/304.'

  explanation: All students must take a total of at least eight departmentals. In
    addition to the four departmental core courses, students must take at least one
    300, 400, or 500-level course with MOL as the primary listing. The remaining three
    departmentals can be chosen from among all 300-or-higher-level MOL, MOL-crosslisted,
    or other approved courses (see list on department website). Note that CHM 301,
    CHM 302/304, and CHM 337 qualify as departmentals. Only courses taken at Princeton
    count as departmentals; there are no exceptions to this rule.

    In the fall semester of the junior year students participate in tutorials in which they read papers from the original literature and prepare two short papers on assigned topics. In the spring semester, students carry out independent work with a faculty adviser with whom they will eventually do their senior thesis research, culminating in a paper in the form of a grant proposal.

    During the senior year each student, with the guidance of a faculty adviser, undertakes a major research effort. This research project can be a laboratory or non-laboratory-based study that will be written and presented as a senior thesis.
