explanation: Concentrators are required to complete at least nine religion courses
  taught by department faculty (including visitors to the department of religion)
  by the end of their senior year. Courses taken prior to declaring a Religion major
  count toward this total. In addition, students are encouraged, but not required,
  to take two approved cognate courses in other departments. The cognate courses will
  be calculated into departmental honors. The departmental representative must approve
  cognate courses.

        student will establish their thematic designation in conversation with the
        Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUS) when they enter the Department in
        the Spring of their sophomore year. Students may also name and design their
        own theme and identify courses they consider pertinent. The DUS will suggest
        courses and, in conversation with the faculty, grant final approval to students’
        course plans.

          Students in this thematic examine the relationship between religion and politics in multiple domains of life. Questions range from the notion of a just society to legal debates over religious freedom. How do human values relate to power? How do religious traditions characterize justice, community, and a good society? What role does religion play in political life and organizations? How can we think about changing configurations of religion, politics, the state, the secular, and the private sphere?

          How does one define a “religious text?” How can one analyze and interpret religion through art, literature, music, and poetry? How are canons of knowledge and authority in religious traditions established? Who is included and excluded? How do sources outside of the elite canon of religious literature such as material culture, artifacts, and print/electronic media redefine or undermine dominant conceptions of traditional canons? These are the sort of questions explored in this thematic.

          How do different religious and philosophical traditions understand and contest questions of gender and sexuality? How do race and religion intersect in different contexts in the Global North and South? How do mainstream as well as marginalized groups and identities find expression and political agency in and through religious discourse? In what ways is the academic study of religion itself implicated in histories of colonialism, racism, and empire? These are among the questions that guide this thematic.

  explanation: In conjunction with REL 399, the Junior Colloquium, during the fall
    term juniors will produce a five to seven-page JP proposal. During the spring
    term, juniors will continue this independent research and write a 30-40 page junior
    paper under supervision of a faculty adviser. The departmental representative,
    in consultation with the director of the colloquium, will assign advisers. At
    the end of junior year, students will review their work in the department and
    discuss with a faculty committee their plans for senior independent work.

    Every senior will prepare a 70-90 page thesis under the supervision of a faculty adviser. The departmental representative in consultation with the chair of the department will assign advisors.

    At the end of the year, students will take an oral examination concerning their senior independent work, focus of study, and work in the department generally.

    Those students considering graduate work in religion are strongly advised to develop a reading knowledge of languages most appropriate to their focus of study, for example, Hebrew, Greek, Latin, Arabic, Chinese, Japanese, German, and French.
