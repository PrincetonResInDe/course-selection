Up to two of the five departmental courses may be taken at the 200-level (but FRE 207 and 208, or ITA 207 and 208, cannot both be counted). As independent work, concentrators complete two junior papers and a senior thesis, all under close supervision by professors in the department (one advisor for each JP; two for the senior thesis). Independent work does not have to be written in the foreign language. Students who elect to concentrate in French or Italian are often simultaneously enrolled in certificate programs, such as African Studies, Contemporary European Politics and Society, European Cultural Studies, Gender and Sexuality Studies, Latin American Studies, Theater, and Dance, or Visual Arts.",

For students following tracks 2, 3, and 4, joint supervision may be arranged.
