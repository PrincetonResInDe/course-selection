An NES JP is normally an essay of 20 to 30 double-spaced pages focusing on a topic related to the Near East. The JP most often addresses aspects of the history, societies, religions, politics and/or cultures of the Near East, but students have tackled subjects in fields as diverse as medical anthropology and the economics of the energy industry. The department does not require students to use sources in a Near Eastern language, but does strongly encourage students who are sufficiently proficient to do so.\n\nThe Junior Paper should offer critical analysis of a specific subject or problem, not merely a passive review of the existing literature or a summary of facts. Advice on completing a work of independent research in NES, targeted towards the senior thesis, and is worth consulting early and often while writing the JP as well.",
