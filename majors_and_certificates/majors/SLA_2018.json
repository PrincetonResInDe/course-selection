Students who wish to write about other Slavic traditions (e.g., Czech or Polish), assuming they have the linguistic competence, are encouraged to do so. The second paper is a paper in Russian (2,000 words), completed as part of a non-credit-bearing junior seminar in the spring semester.  The Russian paper is normally devoted to the analysis of a Russian short story or poem chosen by the student (in consultation with the instructor of the junior seminar), but could be on any topic of the student's choosing",
