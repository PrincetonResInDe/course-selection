Please note that the AP BC calculus curriculum is not sufficient since it only teaches univariate calculus, while MAT 175 focuses on multivariate calculus.\n\nStudents who wish to take math-track econometrics (ECO 312), upper level finance certificate courses (such as ECO 462, ECO 465 and ECO 466), or pursue graduate studies in economics and finance should take MAT 201 and MAT 202 instead of MAT 175. Both courses should be taken for a letter grade by this subset of students. The finance certificate program strongly advises that you take both MAT 201 and MAT 202; only the highest of the two grades is recorded for the purpose of fulfilling the entry requirements. Students who choose to fulfill this requirement by taking the one-semester MAT 175 will be responsible for mastering the linear algebra part of the curriculum on their own.",
