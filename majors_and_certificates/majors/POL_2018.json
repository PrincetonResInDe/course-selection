Junior Workshops will meet every other week of the Fall teaching period and on alternating weeks, students are required to view online plenary session video modules and attend a 50-minute discussion section. The plenary component provides common instruction in research procedures and techniques. In their Fall Junior Workshops, juniors will complete a series of assignments building up to a research prospectus. [NOTE: Junior Workshops are not considered courses and do not count toward satisfying departmental course requirements.] In the spring semester, juniors will complete a Junior Paper under the supervision of an independent work adviser. Students must achieve at least a “D” on each of their two semesters of junior independent work as well as an average of a “C” or above across the two. If the average of the two is below “C” or one of the two receives an “F”, a second Junior Paper is required (with a grade that brings the average of the Fall JIW and the Summer JP grades to at least a “C” or better). This is a prerequisite for beginning the senior year. For purposes of this requirement, the grades before the application of any late penalties are used.",
