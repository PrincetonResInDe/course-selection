The senior independent work is a major studio project completed by the end of the spring term, which is done in consultation with the student's advisers. Students are assigned semiprivate studios on the second floor of 185 Nassau. Students present their work in an exhibition at the end of the year at the Lewis Center. The grade for the senior independent work represents an evaluation of the entire year's studio work and is the average of two grades: (1) the average of the grades given by the student's three advisers; and (2) the average of the grades given by the rest of the Program in Visual Arts faculty who view the senior exhibition. A separate grade is given for the student's oral defense of the thesis exhibition by his/her thesis advisers only.",
