The Technology distribution requires two courses, one of which is ARC 311: Building Science and Technology–Building Systems. The Design Seminar distribution requires ARC 206.\n\nArchitecture concentrators take the following sequence of courses in their junior and senior year: Junior Studio, which consists of ARC 350 and ARC 351, and two required history and theory courses: ARC 308: History of Architectural Theory (taken in the fall of the junior year) and ARC 403: Topics in the History and Theory of Architecture in the fall semester of the senior year. These courses introduce methodologies of historical analysis and research, the literature of the field, and varieties of architectural writing.\n\nIn the fall semester of their senior year, students are required to enroll in ARC 404: Advanced Design Studio. ARC 404 is centered around independent design projects in that synthesize students’ training and interests and investigate new approaches to representation.",
