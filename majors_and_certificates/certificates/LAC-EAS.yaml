The paper could be either an original piece of research or a Junior Paper or Senior Thesis.

Students interested in earning a certificate should apply at the department office by the end of their junior year.\n\nStudents placing into higher level language courses may still qualify for the certificate by substituting EAS-prefixed and cognate courses for language work.
