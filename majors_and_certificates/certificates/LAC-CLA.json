This can be satisfied in several ways:\n \nby a substantial paper growing out of one of the courses taken to fulfill the certificate requirement (this will be in addition to the work required in the course).\nby a substantial paper on a topic agreed upon with an instructor in the department and approved by the program.\nwith the agreement of the home department and the program, by a piece of independent work that will satisfy the requirements of both home department and program. As a substitute for this requirement, students may either take an additional course in their language at the 200 or 300 level or a CLA course focusing on the culture of their certificate program.\n",
