description: The program offers classes in Africa’s political, economic, and social history; 
built environments and urban geographies; ecology, genetic diversity, and epidemiological concerns. 
The program also offers classes in Africa’s vibrant art scenes, past and present, where literature, music, and art have come to define a new post-colonial African cosmopolitanism. 
Certificate students can also learn Swahili and Twi in preparation for either a PIIRS global seminar or summer internship in Africa.
