  "description": "In order to qualify for the B.S.E. degree in the Department of Chemical and Biological Engineering, a student must satisfy the requirements of the School of Engineering and Applied Science and must choose courses during the sophomore, junior, and senior years to provide a core knowledge of chemical engineering and advanced knowledge in an area of concentration. The advanced science and core chemical engineering courses in the sophomore and junior years provide the fundamental tools of thermodynamics, transport processes, and reactor analysis. In the spring semester of the junior year, students take a laboratory-based course that utilizes core chemical engineering knowledge. In the senior year, students undertake an in-depth design analysis with state-of-the-art design and optimization tools. Students can tailor their specific interests in chemical and biological engineering by pursuing an area of concentration that culminates with a senior thesis project. The areas of concentration, reflective of the practice of modern chemical engineering, include bioengineering and biotechnology; materials and product engineering; energy and environmental engineering; optimization, dynamics, and information technology; entrepreneurship and management; and science and engineering for new technologies. The chemical engineering program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, http://www.abet.org (link is external). Students with special interests should consult the section on special programs and options. Total courses: 36.",
