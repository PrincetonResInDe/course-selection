  "description": "Computer science concentrators must take 8 departmental courses (departmentals) and do independent work.  The minimum amount of independent work depends on whether you are an AB candidate (4 semesters minimum) or a BSE candidate (1 semester minimum). Departmental courses are any computer science course at the 300 or 400 level (except 397, 398, 497 and 498) and a specific set of courses in other departments (enumerated below).  There is also a distribution requirement within the 8 departmental courses: you must take at least 2 Systems departmentals, at least 2 Theory departmentals, and at least 2 Applications departmentals.  (Notice that leaves you 6 departmentals that are constrained and 2 departmentals that are unconstrained.)  \n\nBSE candidates do independent work by signing up for COS 397 or 398 in the junior year, or COS 497 or 498 in the senior year. You encouraged to do more than one semester of independent work; the second semester of independent work may be counted as a departmental. \n\nAB candidates do 2 one-semester junior independent work projects and a full year senior thesis.  Numbered courses are not used to designate AB independent work.",

A junior project normally involves the study and solution of specific problems, often associated with a research project. It may require a significant programming effort, a theoretical study involving the design and analysis of algorithms, or an applications problem in some other field. The results of these efforts must be presented in two written reports and posters that correspond to the work undertaken in each of the terms. The senior thesis may be a study in greater depth of one of the subjects considered in junior independent work, or it may deal with another aspect of computer science and its application.\n\nIndependent work is one of the unique features of a Princeton education. Independent projects typically arise either from an idea that excites you or from an idea put forth by a professor in the department. The department maintains a wiki of faculty research interests. This list is a good place to start in looking for a project or advisor. There is also some general advice on finding a topic, an adviser, and a successful outcome here.\n\nOnce you have a project, get a form (located on the bulletin board outside the Computer Science undergraduate office) and sign it along with your advisor to let us know what you'll be doing. Your project is then between you and your advisor, but there is always a COS Independent Work Coordinator who coordinates all independent work, and schedules public talks, checkpoints, and other requirements.\n\nIt is possible to do a project with a faculty member in another department if you have the approval of the Independent Work Coordinator.",
